# crit-phone
## crit-phone is a colection of phone apps for the scalePhone framework.

## Contains:
* Contacts App:
  * Supports bots and all currently online players.
  * You can call and/or message both bots and players.
  * You can set Sleep Mode to `true` which will block all incoming calls or messages (only from players >:) )
* Working Snapmatic and Settings apps.
* Messages and Emails:
  * You can receive and view both messages and emails. Not much here.
* Numpad app:
  * Working numpad app. Event can be modified to trigger any function or event, if a specific number is called / used.
* GPS app:
  * Shows your current XYZ coords, and Zone name (localized!)
* Life Invader app:
  * This is some sort of Twitter app. You can write posts and send it to everyone. Posts use the email view to show up. It has support for textures, but you can't add them, for now at least.
  * In the future, I might include some sort of Player **Bio** too, but not now.
* "More Apps" app:
  * This is a generic menu, where you can connect all your other apps. This is a workaround for the current "9 homepage apps" limit on scalePhone framework.
